## Vision and Motivation

Back before the famous dotcom bubble, the dream was to create an internet of equality and peer-to-peer engagement. However, in the post dotcom era, giant centralized corporations came in and created an internet vastly different. 

Now the dream has returned with the promise of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. This technology suggests that all participants have an opportunity to engage and generate economic value for their earned contributions in the network. 
				
In a decentralized digital network, governance is distributed among all individuals rather than the centralized organization. Each individual is programmatically compensated according to their efforts on the network.

Utilizing these technologies ignites great motivation for creating a platform with long term sustainability for its participants. It also promises inclusion for those unbanked individuals to gain equal opportunity.

For the next billion users to come online and use crypto as part of their daily lives, a lot needs to change. Simplicity and utility needs to be at the forefront of our thinking as we create systems and applications. The motivation toward achieving this will definitely set the course for its ultimate success.

It is estimated that 400 million entrepreneurs worldwide are collaborating to start 300 million companies, out of which ⅓ become newly opened businesses. That is approximately 100 million new businesses per year or 275 thousand each day. (India and China are the two largest startup nations with estimations of 50 thousand startups per day). [[1]](#references)

The vision is an ecosystem that freely supports collaboration and increases the success rate of ideas, projects and businesses. 

## Abstract

The Pitchday is a network which allows anyone to collaborate, support and contribute to other participants securely in a decentralized way. Where ownership is immutable and contribution is rewarded through a blockchain based smart contract system. 

The Pitchday Token (PDT) is the transport for each transaction within the network and between each participant. Allowing them to freely share information, exchange value peer-to-peer. It enables compensation between the system and between users of the system. It allows autonomous voting. 

Pitchday aims to tokenize the future of collaborative creations. It aims to tokenize individuals and businesses. It aims to bring a sustainable monetization model for all participants through the exchange of PDT.

## The Pitchday Token (PDT)

Pitchday will introduce a token named PDT. The token is used for platform activity such as onboarding, chat, pitching, payments and contributions. The token accounts for all economic activity and transactions and will interoperate with projects on the platform.
						
**The token is essential to the platform for the following reasons:**

- The token is used as a compensation for participants to engage with the network.
- The token is the fuel enabling payments between users; and between the system and its users.


**The blockchain supports and provides the following to the platform:**

- Integrity: Cryptographic keys and Smart Contracts guarantee privacy and ownership enabling engagement with the network and its participants. 
- Security: Immutable and encrypted transactions insure anonymity. The decentralized model makes the system unhackable.
- Democracy: Stakeholders make protocol decisions by consensus.
- Faster Transactions: Transaction settlement almost instantaneously. 

PDT is a token with fixed supply. 168 million are created for the pre-sale and 312 million will be created across 4 years by mining the block. The token is fractionally divisible and long term non-inflationary by issuing a certain quantity each year. PDT will be implemented on a forked version of the Ethereum blockchain. 

## The Pitchday Ecosystem
The economy is built upon its community in multiple market categories using the platform to conduct fast, secure and disintermediary transactions. The community is made up of individuals and entities that collaborate and pitch their future ideas, projects or growing businesses to each other. The community also includes decentralized infrastructure providers to maintain the blockchain.
### Stakeholders
#### Collaborators
Participants earn PDT for joining the platform, connecting to projects, pitching ideas, forming teams and gaining backers.
#### Nodes (Miners)
Earn PDT by providing computing power, transaction validation and data storage.
#### Backers
Use PDT to support ideas and projects.
#### PDT Token Holders
Govern the network and provide the fuel for enabling transactions.

## System Technical Consideration
The system is built on top of Ethereum and IPFS protocol layers. This section covers general technical considerations for the Pitchday network.
### The Network
Pitchday is a decentralized and distributed network solving the following: 
#### Micro transactions
1. Peer-to-Peer
2. No Fees
#### Pseudonymous payments
1. Private
2. Secure
3. Low Fee
### Service Nodes
Infrastructure of Miners. Storage providers, Stakeholders 
1. Consensus voting
2. Mining contributions

## Application Use Case
The following use case will be supported in version v1.0 of the platform.
1. **User activity.** Users interacting with the network earn PDT for transactions such as: onboarding users, connecting, collaborating, chat etc..
2. **Individuals collaborating.** User collaboration allows for immutable ownership for projects
3. **Collaborators/Team's pitching.** Users collaborating on projects pitch users in the network to gain support and further backing.
4. **Startups pitching.** Ready state projects, Startups and Businesses pitch the network to gain support and backing.

### Smart Contracts
The smart contracts govern the application in the following ways:
- **Between Users and the network.**
- **Between Users.** Smart contracts are formed between collaborators and between backers and pitched projects and or businesses. 
  - Smart contract between collaborators for ownership on project
  - Smart contract between backer and pitch for ownership of project
